# Sympl - The no bullshit CSS framework.

The need for simple came to be when I saw that most frameworks were:

1. Not optimized for me.
2. Bloated.

I wanted a super simple framework, which had:

1. A baseline defined on 100% (16px)
2. An HTML5 skeleton made and ready to go.
3. Default anchor style changed, and underline removed.
4. A menu set to display:inline.
5. Retina favicons set in the HTML; all required favicon files placed in root.
6. [Necolas' normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) on the top.
7. A byline in the footer.

&hellip;and I made just that.

&hellip;and now it's open source.

### Changelog

#### v1.2:

1. Added retina favicon support. Courtesy [Mathias Bynens](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/touch-icons).
2. Added quotes to `blockquote` using CSS.


*Hope you like it! Enjoy!*
