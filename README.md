# Sympl - The no bullshit CSS framework.

The need for simple came to be when I saw that most frameworks were:

1. Not optimized for me.
2. Bloated.

I wanted a super simple framework, which had:

1. A baseline defined on 100% (16px)
2. An HTML5 skeleton made and ready to go.
3. Default anchor style changed, and underline removed.
4. A menu set to display:inline.
5. Wrappers set.
6. Has [Necolas' normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/).
7. Has a byline in the footer.

&hellip;and I made just that.

&hellip;and now it's open source. Improved plenty of times after learning from project experiences, I decided to let Sympl be in the hands of awesome developers who would tweak it, improve it, and make it better for people to use.

*Hope you like it! Enjoy!*
