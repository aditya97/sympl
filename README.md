## What is Sympl?

**Sympl is the no bullshit HTML5/CSS framework.**

Put simply, Sympl is a super simple framework to make static websites. Sympl is light, but has the correct features to get you started and going. It's developed by [Namanyay Goel](http://namanyayg.com/).

I made Sympl because I was tired with the traditional frameworks, all which were:

1. Bloated. (I didn't use more than half the things half as many times I used them)
2. Not perfect everywhere. (Each had too much of accessories and extras like buttons, notes, most which I'll never use)

&hellip;And thus, Sympl was born.

## Why use Sympl?

Simply because it's simple. And amazing. Here are a few features:

* A good vertical rhythym defined.
* A HTML5 skeleton made, and ready to go.
* A great grid, having half, quarter, one third, and two third columns going on.
* Anchors set up&mdash;No underline, and no ugly blue.
* Added retina favicons. All files ready + code in header.
* Beautiful form elements + One button style.
* CSS starts with [Necolas' normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/).
* Javascript starts with [HTML5Shiv](http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/).

Sympl is lightweight, fast, ready to go, and always usable. You can use it in each and every project, and you'll see that you use *all* of the things bundled with Sympl.
