# Sympl - The no bullshit HTML5/CSS framework.

I thought of making Sympl when I noticed that:

1. Not optimized for me.
2. Bloated.

I wanted a super simple framework, which had:

* A baseline defined on 100% (16px)
* An HTML5 skeleton made and ready to go.
* Default anchor style changed, and underline removed.
* A menu set to display:inline.
* Retina favicons set in the HTML; all required favicon files placed in root.
*  [Necolas' `normalize.css`](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) on the top.
* A byline in the footer.
* [HTML5Shiv](http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/) in it's javascript.

&hellip;and I made just that.
